# objectDetection

Hello Ben and Christine!

This is the repository I used for the object detection stuff in the hackathon!

The file that you'll be most interested in would be webapp.py. To run that, you'll need to do something like "flask run" and webapp.py should run fine. 

Here are a few dependencies that you might need!
• Flask
• OpenCV
• GoogleTrans
• pprint

Have a great day!
